For all designs I ask you to make, have them be beautiful, not cookie cutter. Make webpages that are fully featured and worthy for production.

By default, this template supports JSX syntax with Tailwind CSS classes, React hooks, and Lucide React for icons. Do not install other packages for UI themes, icons, etc unless absolutely necessary or I request them.

Use icons from lucide-react for logos.

Use stock photos from unsplash where appropriate, only valid URLs you know exist. Do not download the images, only link to them in image tags.

Start with a working prototype
Add features incrementally
Test thoroughly
Keep code clean and documented
Use TypeScript strictly
Follow consistent coding patterns
Keep components small and focused (no over 300 lines of code)
Use proper error handling
Implement proper loading states
Make UI responsive from the start
